Our vision is to be the first hiring platform that puts developer health first. We\'ve seen burnout all too often in tech and we are on a mission to push back against it. We are building a "deep job platform" that will also offer services to support the physical/mental health of software developers in addition to matching them with jobs that are in line with our vision. We don\'t believe we can see our vision through unless we model it internally which is why we work 4 day work weeks, value async communication, and have flexible schedules.</p>\n<p><strong>About Michelle Bakels</strong></p>\n<p>Michelle Bakels is the Program Director at G2i where she creates community-focused solutions for developer health and burnout, and has spent the last several years as a software engineer in south Florida.</p>\n<p>Outside of G2i, Michelle is passionate about creating equitable spaces and opportunities in tech and serves as the Chair of Code Palm Beach, and Co-Chair of Tech Hub South Florida‚Äôs Women\'s Council.</p>',
